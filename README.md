# Course-Advisor

The Problem :
The problem we tried to solve today was one that University students face on a regular basis. When you need to decide which courses to take, it often is a struggle to find credible resources to tell you about the course. Moreover, the limited information you gather is from a few friends or seniors that have taken the particular course before. 

Now, with "CourseAdvisor", we provide a way to crowd-source this information from a really wide array of users. It builds on the untapped potential of facebook and connects you to people who are ready to guide you forward basis different courses and various characteristics linked with it. You can ask questions, get feedback, read reviews, check up on the difficulty and so much more with CourseAdvisor. It connects on a social platform all courses among all universities in the world to create beautiful social communities based on universities, courses, interests etc fueled by educative and informative discussion.

Moreover on a secondary note, with CourseAdvisor, professors and tutors can get ample feedback on how their course is percieved and can thus improve and change their course structures to suit the students. 

Thus by incorporating the mass appeal of Facebook combined with educative and informative concept, we come up with a Social Academia which solves the pain-point of many students like us and eventually, makes ours and their life easier.
