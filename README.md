# Course-Advisor

The Problem :
The problem we tried to solve today was one that University students face on a regular basis. When you need to decide which courses to take, it is a struggle to find credible sources to tell you about the course. Moreover, this limited information leads to bad decisions being made. 

Now, with "CourseAdvisor", we provide a way to crowd-source this information from your friends and other students from your university.
You can ask questions, get feedback, read reviews, check the difficulty with CourseAdvisor. It builds on a social platform to create beautiful social communities based on universities, courses, interests etc fueled by educative and informative discussion. It allows you to see which friends have taken this course before and which of your friends are interested in taking it.

Moreover, we provide insights into the the courses and lets you know about the most popular courses, the easiest ones or the most interesting courses.

Moreover on a secondary note, with CourseAdvisor, professors and tutors can get ample feedback on how their course is percieved and can thus improve and change their course structures to suit the students. 

Thus by incorporating the mass appeal of Facebook combined with educative and informative concept, we come up with a Social Academia which solves the pain-point of many students like us and eventually, makes ours and their life easier.
